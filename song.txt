Holding me back
Gravity's holding me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?

Nothing to say
When everything gets in the way
It seems we cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who can stay
Oh oh oh

In this world
It's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world
It's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was
You know it's not the same

Answer the phone
"harry, you're no good alone"
